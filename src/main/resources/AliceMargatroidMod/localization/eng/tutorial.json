      "Alice can control #yDolls, helping her in battle. NL Alice has 7 Doll slots，each #yfrom #yright #yto #yleft receives #rattack damage from an enemy #yfrom #yleft #yto #right. NL (In short, the closest corresponds to the closest.) NL Unlike #bOrbs from original game, there can be gaps between #yDolls.",
      "Damage and Block from #yDolls will not be affected by #yWeak or #yFrail, but their damage can be affected by enemies' #rVulnerable. NL NL The #rRed number above a #yDoll indicates damage it will receive, and the bracketed #rRed number indicates overflow damage Alice will receive.",
      "Some Alice cards can be played on #yDolls or slots. NL The available targets will be displayed at its right border. NL When hovering over a card, the tip of available targets will be shown.",
      "爱丽丝总共有 7 种 #y人偶 ，每种 #y人偶 都有不同的效果。 NL NL （七色的人偶使有七种人偶很合理吧！）",
